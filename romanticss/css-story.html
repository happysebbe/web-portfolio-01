			<p>In the process of doing projects together, designing and coding over many cups of coffee, the inevitable happened. Anjali stole her colleague Anil’s heart. Considering that her UI designs are as beautiful as herself, Anil was undoubtedly an eager victim.</p>
			<p>But her dad Sharmaji was furious. He was a fan of Flash and ActionScript. So for him, Anil the hotshot HTML5 dude was definitely bad news. Matters were about to turn very ugly indeed. Just in the nick of time, Anjali’s aunt Nita rushed in. She pacified her brother Sharmaji – explaining to him about the advantages and the bright future of HTML5.</p>
			<p>What makes this story interesting is that all the characters, objects, and effects in the scene are <strong>made using CSS – each of them fashioned from <span>a Single &lt;div&gt;</span> each.</strong></p>
			<p>Now, what happens next? Would Anjali and Anil break-up to languish and pine away in loneliness, or would they live happily married ever after?</p>
